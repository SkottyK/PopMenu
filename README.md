PopMenu
=======

A menu system for iOS apps that keeps all elements within the natural range of your thumb, regardless of screen size.

The iPhone 5 and especially the iPhone 6 and 6+ are too large to be operated easily with one hand using most menu systems. When using only one hand, it is crucial that all major action elements are within range of your thumb. By concentrating the entire menu in the lower right corner (lower left for left handed users) any page in the application can be accessed without contorting your hand.
